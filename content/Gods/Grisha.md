## Story
Once an assassin driven by vengeance, Grisha transformed through trials and tribulations into a god of rebirth and redemption. Casting aside his daggers and the shadows of his past, he took up the scythe, devoting himself to the cycles of growth, renewal, and life—finding solace in the simplicity of gardening. His followers seek the same rebirth, striving to attain their perfect selves through faith, discipline, and strict adherence to Grisha’s teachings. While seen as rigid and dogmatic by outsiders—even by worshipers of other gods—the faithful of Grisha are unwavering in their pursuit of redemption. Only those who endure his demanding path and embrace its challenges are rewarded with the true transformation Grisha promises: a rebirth into their most true, perfected form.
