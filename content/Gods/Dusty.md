## Story
Once a lowly dust mephit, Dusty’s ascension to godhood was as improbable as it was legendary. Through a mix of wild luck, hedonism, and a fateful encounter with divine power, he was imbued with a spark that propelled him into the realm of the divine. Now revered as the Patron Saint of Summoning, Dusty opened the way for mortals to forge deep connections with their summoned creatures and eidolons. His chaotic but benevolent(?) influence is credited with popularizing the art of summoning among professional adventurers, creating a legacy where summoners and their companions stand side by side in trust and partnership. Dusty’s worshipers often celebrate his carefree spirit while embracing the deeper bond between mortal and summoned ally.
