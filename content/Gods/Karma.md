## Story
Karma, the latest god to bear the mantle of Time, holds a unique place in the cosmos, both feared and revered. His rise is a subject of intense study among monks and scholars alike, as he embodies the sporadic yet vital cycle of time gods. He takes his responsibilities gravely, defending the integrity of the timeline from distortions and mysterious deaths that befall those too slow to act. Karma’s followers, resilient and disciplined, attribute their survival to his boons and the rigorous pilgrimages they undertake in his name. Both Karma and his disciples are dedicated to preserving history and destiny, maintaining that without a future, the present is meaningless. Their guiding mantra—“There is no moment to cherish if the world ends”—shapes their tireless efforts to safeguard the flow of time for all.
