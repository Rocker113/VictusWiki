## Story
Aia, often called a reluctant deity, is a god of memory and passion who distances herself from the adoration she inspires. Though she walked the Great Plane in pilgrimage, Aia never sought followers. Yet, her quiet wisdom and the comfort she offers from the plagues of the world draw many to her cause. Her followers—aloof and disorganized—reflect her detached demeaner, yet their devotion is undeniable. Though she no longer walks among mortals, Aia offers them solace through fleeting guidance, moments of relief, and even the occasional melody carried on the wind. Those who seek her favour find respite in the chaos of memory and emotion, even as they are left to wander in their own way.
